# LeadBuilt Branding and Naming Guidelines

## Brand Name Usage

### Correct Usage
- **Primary Brand**: "LeadBuilt" (one word, camelCase)
- **Platform Reference**: "Lead Built platform" (when referring to the service)
- **API Reference**: "LeadBuilt API V2" (always include version)
- **Company Reference**: "LeadBuilt" or "Lead Built" (context dependent)

### Incorrect Usage (Legacy Names to Replace)
- ❌ "GoHighLevel" → ✅ "LeadBuilt"
- ❌ "Go Highlevel" → ✅ "Lead Built"
- ❌ "HighLevel" → ✅ "LeadBuilt"
- ❌ "GHL" → ✅ "LeadBuilt"

## Documentation Consistency

### API Documentation
- All OpenAPI titles should reference "LeadBuilt API V2"
- Endpoint descriptions should use "LeadBuilt" consistently
- Example data should reflect LeadBuilt branding
- Error messages should reference LeadBuilt services

### File Headers and Descriptions
```json
{
  "info": {
    "title": "LeadBuilt API V2 - [Module Name]",
    "description": "API endpoints for [functionality] in the Lead Built platform",
    "version": "2.0"
  }
}
```

### Common Phrases and Replacements
- "GoHighLevel account" → "LeadBuilt account"
- "HighLevel platform" → "Lead Built platform"
- "GHL integration" → "LeadBuilt integration"
- "GoHighLevel API" → "LeadBuilt API V2"
- "HighLevel marketplace" → "LeadBuilt marketplace"

## URL and Domain References

### API Base URLs
- Production: `https://services.leadbuilt.com/`
- Documentation: Reference LeadBuilt domains
- Webhook URLs: Use LeadBuilt-branded examples

### Legacy URL Patterns to Update
- Any references to `gohighlevel.com` domains
- Legacy API endpoints with old branding
- Marketplace URLs with old naming

## Contact Information and Support

### Updated Contact References
- Support: Reference LeadBuilt support channels
- Marketplace: `marketplace@leadbuilt.com` (if applicable)
- Documentation: LeadBuilt documentation team

### Terms of Service and Legal
- Update references to LeadBuilt terms of service
- Ensure compliance documentation reflects current branding
- Legal notices should reference LeadBuilt entities

## Code Examples and Samples

### API Request Examples
```javascript
// Correct branding in comments and examples
const leadBuiltAPI = new LeadBuiltAPI({
  apiKey: 'your-leadbuilt-api-key'
});

// Get contacts from Lead Built platform
const contacts = await leadBuiltAPI.contacts.list();
```

### Response Examples
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Data retrieved from LeadBuilt successfully",
  "data": {
    "platform": "Lead Built",
    "version": "2.0"
  }
}
```

## Marketplace and Integration References

### App Descriptions
- "Integrate with the Lead Built platform"
- "LeadBuilt marketplace application"
- "Built for LeadBuilt users"

### OAuth and Authentication
- "Authenticate with LeadBuilt"
- "LeadBuilt OAuth 2.0 implementation"
- "Access Lead Built platform resources"

## File and Directory Naming

### Consistent Naming Patterns
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names
- Avoid legacy brand names in new file names
- Maintain consistency with existing structure

### Documentation Files
- README files should prominently feature LeadBuilt branding
- Changelog entries should reference LeadBuilt updates
- License files should reflect current brand ownership
